    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px">
        About the size of a turkey, the southern ground hornbill is the largest species of hornbill on Earth.
        <br>It can fly up to 18 miles an hour and has an impressive wingspan that reaches about four feet across.
        <br>The bird is recognizable by its jet-black feathers, yellow eyes, and bright red throat.
        <br>The fleshy part of the bird’s throat, called a wattle,identifies its sex: The throat of a male hornbill is completely red,
        <br> whereas a female sports a patch of violet blue. Male hornbills can inflate their wattles during mating season to attract females.
        <br> This vocal bird also uses its wattle to make booming calls that are so loud, they’re often mistaken for a lion’s roar. </p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px">
        Southern ground hornbills are carnivorous and mostly hunt on the ground, where they find the majority of their food.
        <br>This food ranges from insects to small animals. Their nests are often found in high in tree cavities or other shallow cavities,
        <br> such as rock holes in cliff faces. These birds are a long lived species, having lifespans in the range of 50–60 years, and up to 70 in captivity.
        <br> In relation to their long lives, they do not reach sexual maturity until 4–6 years old, and begin breeding around 10 years old. Their sex can be identified by the color of their throats, where the male's is pure red and the female's is a deep violet-blue. </p>
